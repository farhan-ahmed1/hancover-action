A GitHub Action that generates comprehensive coverage reports with change detection for Pull Requests. Supports multiple coverage formats and provides dynamic badges showing coverage changes compared to the main branch.

## Features

- **Multiple format support**: LCOV, Cobertura, JaCoCo, and Clover coverage files
- **Change detection**: Automatic baseline comparison using GitHub Gists
- **Dynamic badges**: Coverage and change badges that update automatically
- **Smart analysis**: Package grouping, diff coverage, and delta calculations  
- **Sticky comments**: Clean PR comments that update instead of spam
- **Threshold checking**: Configurable coverage requirements
- **Secure**: Minimal permissions, input validation, and safe parsing

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Coverage
on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test -- --coverage
      
      - name: Coverage Report
        uses: farhan-ahmed1/hancover-action@v1
        with:
          files: coverage/lcov.info
          min-threshold: 80
```

### With Change Detection (Recommended)

Enable change badges by setting up a GitHub Gist for baseline storage:

```yaml
Enable change badges by setting up a GitHub Gist for baseline storage:

    gist-id: ${{ secrets.COVERAGE_GIST_ID }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    min-threshold: 80
```

## Security

HanCover is designed with security as a top priority:

- **Minimal permissions**: Only requires `pull-requests: write` and `contents: read`
- **Safe parsing**: XXE protection, input validation, and secure XML processing
- **Size limits**: Built-in protections against large file attacks
- **Supply chain security**: Signed releases, dependency scanning, and regular audits

**Security best practices:**
```yaml
# Pin to specific versions
uses: farhan-ahmed1/hancover-action@v1.0.0

# Avoid using branches or tags
uses: farhan-ahmed1/hancover-action@main
```
